// Materialised per-account wealth totals for the admin dashboard (p2p market
// oversight). One row per account: the purse sum over the account's characters
// plus the two in-transit escrow pools a player can reclaim (mail attachments,
// uncollected market proceeds), refreshed by the periodic sweep in
// server/account_wealth.ts.
//
// Why materialised rather than aggregated live: the purse lives inside the
// characters.state JSONB blob, so a live "ORDER BY total gold" would detoast
// every character's full state on every admin sort/page. The database-visible
// purse only advances on the 30 s autosave anyway, so a ~60 s sweep loses no
// freshness an admin query could ever observe. The account_wealth_total index
// serves the top-holders board directly; the accounts-list gold sort and the
// flagged-account gold trend read the materialised COLUMN (one bigint instead
// of a per-row blob detoast) but keep their surrounding join/aggregate cost,
// the same shape as the list's sibling sorts.
//
// Guild treasuries are deliberately NOT folded into total_copper: the guild
// bank keeps no depositor identity (src/sim/guild_bank.ts, the anonymous-pipe
// doctrine), so any per-member share would be fiction. The account detail
// endpoint surfaces each character's guild treasury as context instead.
