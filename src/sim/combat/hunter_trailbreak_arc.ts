// Trailbreak's launch planner: the hunter's backward leap is a real ballistic
// hop through the shared movement kernel (player_motion.ts), not a scripted
// flight, so air control, fence clearance, and the landing rules all apply to
// it unchanged. The flat hop arc crests about 1.1 yards, so on ground that
// RISES behind the hunter the arc met the hillside after a tick or two and the
// landing killed the horizontal velocity: a 12-yard leap that travelled one.
//
// The fix plans the launch against the ground the leap will cross. A sweep
// walks the backward line half a yard at a time, stopping where the kernel
// would stop the body anyway (a face taller than the hop can carry over, a
// wall or a full-height prop) so the landing point is the last spot the body
// can reach. The arc is then the parabola from the feet to that landing point,
// lifted just enough to clear everything sampled between them. Ground that
// does not rise (level, downhill) plans the exact launch the old code used;
// ground that rises by any amount takes the lifted branch, which lands on the
// planned tick instead of the flat hop's one-tick-early undershoot, so a
// near-level cast can differ from a level one by that tick (a 0.15-yard apex).
//
// Pure and host-agnostic: terrain, floor, and collision reads come in through
// `TrailbreakSweepDeps`, so a Vitest can drive it over a synthetic hillside,
// and `trailbreakArcFor` binds the live Sim's own resolvers. Draws no rng.
