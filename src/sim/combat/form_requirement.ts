// One answer to "which druid forms may this button be pressed in?".
//
// `AbilityDef.requiresForm` was a single form for as long as every form button
// belonged to exactly one form. Savage Mending broke that in the v0.43 feral
// pass (a Wildfang heal Bruin and Cat both press), so the field now accepts a
// LIST as well, and this module is the one place that reads it. The cast gate,
// the auto-unshift decision, the tooltip line, and the action bar's form-kit
// seeding all ask here, which is what keeps them from disagreeing about which
// presses are legal.
//
// Pure: no SimContext, no DOM, plain aura kinds in and booleans out, so a
// Vitest can drive it directly and the online client can ask the same question.
