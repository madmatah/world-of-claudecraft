// Nature's Boon, the Wildfang autoattack passive (v0.43 feral pass).
//
// Every LANDED melee auto-attack a committed feral druid makes has a 1-in-15
// chance to arm one free spell for 10 seconds, which at Cat Form's fixed 1.0
// sec swing reads as about one proc every 15 seconds. The armed window covers
// BOTH members at once and the player chooses which to spend it on: whichever
// of Wildbloom or Oakhide is cast first consumes it, and the other reverts.
//
// Two things make the window worth having in a form, and both are deliberate:
//
//   free   The window is an ordinary `next_cast_free` aura scoped by
//          `empowerAbilities`, so the existing cost tail (combat/
//          empower_next.ts) zeroes the cost and the action bar already lights
//          the slot. Nothing new rides the wire.
//   in form  A shapeshifted druid normally cannot cast either spell: the cast
//          gate refuses it, or the auto-unshift rule drops the form to let it
//          through. While the window is armed BOTH of those stand down
//          (casting_lifecycle.ts and form_auto_unshift.ts each ask
//          naturesBoonArmedFor), so the free cast goes off from Cat, Bruin,
//          Fleet, Moonwing, or caster form and the druid keeps the form it is
//          standing in. That is the whole point of the passive.
//
// MELEE auto-attacks only. A wand (or a hunter's Auto Shot) resolves through
// rangedSwing's own projectile callback in combat/auto_attack.ts and never
// reaches the meleeSwing shell this hook hangs off, so a caster-form druid
// plinking with a wand can never arm the window. That is a property of where
// the hook sits rather than a check inside it, so it is pinned by a test
// rather than restated here as a guard that could never fire.
//
// Determinism: the 1-in-15 roll is drawn ONLY after the feral-druid gate has
// passed, so a non-feral player's rng stream stays byte-identical (the
// Cinderbark 2pc precedent in druid_engines.ts). It is one draw per landed
// MELEE auto-attack, never per ability swing and never per wand bolt.
