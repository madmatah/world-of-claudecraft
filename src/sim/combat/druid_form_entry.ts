// Druid form-entry buttons (v0.43): three abilities that PUT YOU IN a form as
// part of pressing them, rather than refusing unless you are already wearing it.
//
//   Stalk (prowl)        -> Cat Form, then stealth
//   Lunge (lunge)        -> Cat Form, then the gap closer
//   Bruin Rush (bear_charge) -> Bruin Form, then the rush
//
// All three are usable in and out of every form. The shift is the same form
// every other route produces, deliberately: it reads the authored form
// ability's own selfBuff for duration and value, and it stamps the aura with
// that FORM ABILITY's id (cat_form / bear_form), not the pressed button's.
// That id is what the form button's own toggle-off looks for (the selfBuff arm
// of effect_dispatch.ts finds the aura by `a.id === ability.id`), so a druid
// who entered Cat through Lunge can still press Cat Form once to stand up.
// Every other reader keys on the aura KIND and cannot tell the routes apart.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do:
//   - charge the form button's own cost. These three bill their own cost (0 for
//     Stalk and Bruin Rush, 40 energy for Lunge) and nothing more.
//   - grant Loping Stride. The shift sprint belongs to the form BUTTONS
//     (FORM_ABILITY_IDS in druid_engines.ts); a stealth opener or a gap closer
//     that also sprinted would break its own pacing.
//
// Resource note, and it is why the cast gate consults this module: entering a
// form SWAPS the bar (entity.ts recalcPlayerStats hands Cat its energy pool and
// Bruin 0 rage). A Lunge pressed from caster or Bruin Form is therefore billed
// against the CAT energy it is about to have, never the mana or rage it is
// standing in, so the affordability gate weighs it against that pool
// (druidFormEntryPool): a full bar out of combat, the parked pool mid-fight
// (combat/cat_form_energy.ts), so a Lunge is no back door to a free refill.
// Draws no rng.
