# src/sim - the deterministic game core

The host-agnostic source of truth: tick loop, combat, abilities/auras, mob AI +
aggro/leash, parties, duels, arena, trade, market, dungeon instances, terrain,
and the RL observation surface. Same code runs offline / on the server / headless.

## Shape of the core: a thin coordinator plus system modules behind one seam
Each self-contained game SYSTEM lives in its own sibling module, and `sim.ts` is a
thin **coordinator**: it owns the world clock, the tick-phase order, the per-player and
per-entity loops, the shared entry points, the `IWorld` facade, and persistence, and it
calls out to the system modules. Those modules never reach into `Sim` internals; they
talk only to the **`SimContext` seam** (`sim_context.ts`).

- **State stays on `Sim`.** The modules hold FUNCTIONS, not state. Entities, the spatial
  grids, `delayedEvents`, `groundAoEs`, arena/duel/trade/delve/market/loot collections,
  and the pet stash are all still `Sim` fields, exposed to the modules as LIVE views on
  `SimContext` (multi-`Sim` isolation + the server's public seam depend on this).
- **`Sim` keeps thin same-named delegates** wherever a foreign caller (the `IWorld`
  surface, `server/`, `headless/`, tests) resolves a method on the `Sim` facade. The
  delegate forwards into the owning module via `this.ctx`.
- Relocations are MOVES, not rewrites: behavior stays byte-identical, proven by the
  golden-trace + rng-draw-order parity gate (`tests/parity`).

## Key files
- **`sim.ts`**: the **coordinator** (`class Sim`). `tick()` is a registry of system
  calls (see the coordinator map below). Also holds the `IWorld` facade delegates, the
  back-compat accessors, the inventory hub (`addItem`/`removeItem`/`countItem`),
  persistence (`serializeCharacter`/`addPlayer`), the shared combat entry points, and
  `buildSimContext()` (binds every `SimContext` callback). Large by design.
- **`sim_context.ts`**: **the seam.** `SimContext` = live primitive views (`rng`/`time`/
  `entities`/`players`/grids/the shared collections) + the cross-system callbacks. The
  file's comments are the authoritative callback registry (signature + which slice owns
  each). Append-only: add callbacks, never rename or repurpose one.
- **`types.ts`**: ALL shared types AND the global tuning constants + classic-era formulas (`TICK_RATE`, `DT`, `GCD`, ranges, `XP_TABLE`, hit/armor/rage math, post-cap `virtualLevel`/prestige). Plus the `SimEvent` union and the `Entity` shape.
- `data.ts`: merges `content/*` into the flat tables (`ABILITIES`, `MOBS`, `NPCS`, `QUESTS`, `ITEMS`, `CAMPS`, `DUNGEONS`) and owns world-layout consts (`WORLD_SIZE`, `instanceOrigin`, `arenaOrigin`, `zoneAt`, `dungeonAt`).
- `entity.ts`: `createPlayer/createMob/createNpc/createGroundObject` + `recalcPlayerStats` (the ONE place derived stats are computed from class/level/gear/auras/talent `mods`).
- `player_motion.ts`: the pure player-movement kernel (`stepPlayerMotion`: turn integration, wish vector, slope gates, swept static collision, the vertical pass) plus `moveSpeedMult`/`auraSpeedMult`/`jumpMult`/`isSwimming` and the locomotion-feel constants. An entity carrying a `drive` state (`VehicleDrive`, a seated rally pilot) takes the VEHICLE branch at the top of the same entry point, composing the pure model in `vehicle_motion.ts` with the same collision and vertical pass; keeping it behind this one entry point is what keeps the online self-extrapolator in lockstep. It also carries the parkour arms (air control, coyote time, ledge momentum, and the standable-prop support/mantle pass fed by `colliders.ts` `supportHeightAt`; behavior pinned by `tests/parkour.test.ts`). `Sim.updatePlayerMovement` wraps it behind `PlayerMotionDeps` (fiesta speed, delve-aware `resolveMove`, cast/damage callbacks); the online display-only self extrapolator (`src/render/self_motion.ts`) binds pure/no-op deps so BOTH hosts run the same math, pinned by `tests/player_motion.test.ts` (client-dep-shape vs live-Sim parity, bit for bit). Changing movement here means keeping that parity test green.
- `entity_roster.ts`: roster ops the coordinator drives: `addEntity`/`dropEntity`/`rebucket`, despawn decay, the delayed-event drain, and the ground-AoE tick. Keeps only the delve release arm (`releaseSpiritInDelve`); the general death/release system is `spirit.ts` (see the module table).
- `rng.ts`: `class Rng` (mulberry32) + stateless `hash2/noise2/fbm2` for terrain.
- `world.ts`: `groundHeight`/`terrainHeight` (pure fn of x,z,seed), `WATER_LEVEL`, `generateDecorations`. **Renderer samples the same fns**: keep them identical. The voxel layer below derives from them too.
- `voxel.ts` + `voxel_mesh.ts`: the true-3D voxel density field layered over the `world.ts` heightfield, plus its chunked mesher. Tunnels/overhangs come ONLY from hand-authored capsules in `content/tunnels.ts` subtracted from solid terrain; away from a tunnel the field's surface must stay byte-identical to `terrainHeight`, so a heightfield edit is also a voxel edit. Engine-only so far (proven by tests, not yet wired into the renderer; `colliders.ts`/`pathfind.ts` are still heightfield-only).
- **`physics/`**: the character physics engine (own `CLAUDE.md`): continuous swept collision against the extruded-2D collider set, multi-pass sliding, depenetration, and STEP UP so a walking body climbs low stones and kerbs with no jump. `player_motion.ts` runs it for the OPEN WORLD; instanced interiors stay on `resolveMove`. Pure leaf set (no `SimContext`), pinned by `tests/physics_character.test.ts`.
- `decoration_dims.ts`: pure leaf, THE source of truth for scatter-decoration size (`rockHeight`/`rockRadius`/`ROCK_SINK_UNITS`). `colliders.ts` builds rock colliders from it and `src/render/foliage.ts` scales the rock GLBs to it, so a stone's silhouette and its collision top cannot drift.
- `colliders.ts`: `resolvePosition` (static collision + slide); reads `PROPS` and the dungeon/arena layouts. Parkour heights live here: low props carry a `moveTopY` movement top (`standable` for crates/rocks and the climbable roofs: stall canopies, the dock hut), the optional `MoverHeight` param lets a mover whose feet clear a top pass over it, and `supportHeightAt` is the standable-surface query the movement kernel maxes against the terrain. Callers passing no height (mobs, pathfinding) collide full-height as before.
- `dungeon_layout.ts`: plain-number interior layouts; single source for BOTH render geometry and `colliders.ts` interior sets.
- `pathfind.ts`: local A* (`findPath`); the player-tuned wrapper `findPlayerPath` (body radius, climb, swim) is what warrior Charge calls via `findChargePath`.
- `threat.ts`: classic-era hate-table math (`addThreat`, `threatModifier`, taunt, stealth detection). Already pure; modules import it directly.
- `spatial.ts`: `SpatialGrid` entity hash for radius queries; re-bucketed at end of tick. Pure; imported directly.
- `format_money.ts`: the sim's plain-English money formatter (`"3g 5s"` fragments for loot/quest/vendor/market emit text). A leaf module so `sim.ts`, `market.ts`, and `loot/loot_roll.ts` share it without a value-cycle. NOT the i18n `formatMoney` (see Player-facing text).
- `world_seed.ts`: `WORLD_SEED`, the one shipped world seed. Every host that builds THE world and every suite asserting its geometry imports it; never re-declare the literal.
- `obs.ts`: RL surface: `ACTIONS`/`applyAction`/`encodeObs`/`obsSize`. Consumed by `headless/` + `python/` (see those dirs).

## System modules behind SimContext (who owns what)
Each module owns the FUNCTIONS for one system; the backing STATE stays on `Sim` as live
`ctx` views, and `Sim` keeps thin delegates where a foreign caller resolves the method.

| `item_instance_transfer.ts` | shared instanced-transfer rules for the anonymous exchange pipes (market listings + mail parcels, issue 1165): the transfer-lock predicate, the public display trim, payload-matching escrow removal, escrow-slot sanitizing; consumed by `market.ts`, `mail/post_office.ts`, and the ui staging gates (the `removePreferFungible` cross-import precedent) |
| `interaction.ts` | `lootCorpse`/`pickUpObject`/`interact` + corpse harvest and party auto-loot (W3) |
| `bags.ts` | pooled bag capacity: the backpack plus equipped bag items raise one flat slot budget |
| `quests/quest_credit.ts` | kill/collect quest credit + turn-in readiness |

| `quests/quest_marker_kind.ts` | `QuestMarkerKind` + `questMarkerKind`/`npcQuestMarkerKind`/`strongerQuestMarker`/`questMarkerRank`: the ONE quest-indicator classification rule the four presentation surfaces consume (nameplate, minimap, world map, gossip list); a pure leaf like `quest_targets.ts`, no SimContext, no rng, no clock |
| `instances/dungeons.ts` | door triggers, enter/leave, instance slots, raid lockouts + raid gates, and the manual instance-reset lifecycle (`resetDungeonInstances` behind `/dungeon reset`, character-keyed cooldowns on the `dungeonResetLocks` primitive, `inheritDungeonResetLocks` on party join) |
| `rift/runs.ts` + `rift/portals.ts` | procedural "Rift" run lifecycle (enter/descend/exit, floor gates, level-20 gate, Heroic Mark rewards) + the ranked (C/B/A/S) world-portal scheduler. See `docs/design/rift-portals.md` |
| `instances/difficulty.ts` + `instances/heroic_vendor.ts` | heroic dungeons: tuning + `dungeonDifficulty`/`setDungeonDifficulty`, `awardHeroicMarks` and kill lockouts; the Heroic Quartermaster marks vendor |

| `delves/companion.ts` | `updateDelveCompanion` |
| `delves/drowned_litany_boss.ts` / `_rite.ts` / `_rooms.ts` | The Drowned Litany delve: room puzzles, the Sister Nhalia boss, the Rite finale (difficulty knobs in `delves/rite_tuning.ts`, shared with the HUD popup) |
| `social/party.ts` | the party/raid machine + `partyOf` |
| `social/dungeon_finder.ts` | the Dungeon Finder (`docs/prd/dungeon-finder.md`): the automatic role queue plus the leader-run premade board; only FORMS groups (via `PartyMachine.formDungeonFinderGroup`), draws no rng; pinned by `tests/dungeon_finder.test.ts` |
| `social/duel.ts` + `social/arena.ts` | duels + ranked arena (Elo, matchmaking) |
| `social/fiesta.ts` + `social/fiesta_bots.ts` | fiesta match logic + offline bots |
| `social/vale_cup.ts` + `social/vale_cup_bots.ts` | Vale Cup boarball: brackets, the one match slot, the `vcup*` seam arms (pure ball math in the `vale_cup_ball.ts`/`vale_cup_layout.ts` leaves); its tick phase draws ZERO shared rng |
| `social/yumi.ts` | Protect Yumi 3v3/5v5 maze mode (layout leaf `yumi_maze_layout.ts`) |
| `social/ready_check.ts` | `/ready`: the `readyChecks` primitive + the `updateReadyChecks` phase |
| `unstuck.ts` | `/unstuck` recovery countdown, the graveyard move (alive) or graveyard revive (dead), cancellation, and cooldown. Charges Unstuck Sickness, never a death |
| `social/card_duel.ts` | the Card Duel minigame (Card Master NPC): queue/match state, the `updateCardDuelQueue` (pairing) and `updateCardDuelDeadlines` (AFK forfeit/void) phases |
| `instances/card_master.ts` | the Card Master NPC proximity gate (`cardMasterInRange`) `social/card_duel.ts` queues against |
| `social/trade.ts` + `social/chat.ts` | player trade; the `chat()` router, emotes, whispers, channel membership (readout formatters in `social/chat_readouts.ts`). `Sim` keeps only a thin `chat()` delegate for the `IWorld` facade; new slash commands land in `social/chat.ts`, never on `Sim` |
| `dev_commands.ts` | the `ctx.devCommands` gated `/dev` cheat surface: `handleDevChat` (re-exported by `social/chat.ts` for the chat router), `spawnMobsForDev`/`despawnMobsForDev` (dev-spawned mobs are torn down in `removePlayer`), `resetCombatForDev`; pinned by `tests/dev_commands.test.ts` |
| `realm_racers_drafts.ts` | `ctx.devCommands` gated: makes a circuit DRAWN in the circuit editor raceable for one session. Validates it through `realm_racers_circuit_metrics.ts` (a broken drawing is refused by name, never seated) and puts it in the `realm_racers_draft_registry.ts` overlay, which `realmRacersCircuitById` and the lane table consult. The sim never fetches: the client hands it a plain record (`src/game/realm_racers_draft_dev.ts`). Pinned by `tests/realm_racers_drafts.test.ts` |
| `targeting.ts` | player target selection + raid markers |
| `market.ts` | the World Market (`Market` class) |
| `mail/post_office.ts` | player mail (send/take/read/delete, the mailbox anchor gate) |
| `bank.ts` | the personal pooled bank (The Gilded Strongbox): capacity math + the container-agnostic `moveBetweenContainers`, `bankDeposit`/`bankWithdraw`/`bankBuySlots`, `bankInfoFor` (boundary-clones), `sanitizeBankState` (the one load path), `nearBanker`; state on `PlayerMeta.bank`, the `bankerIds` anchor list on `Sim`; draws NO rng |
| `guild_bank.ts` | the shared guild treasury + item store (officer-plus): constants, `guildBankCapacity`/`guildBankNextExpansionPrice`, `sanitizeGuildBankState` (the one load path), `loadGuildBank`/`serializeGuildBank` (the server's pure shape in/out seam), `stampGuildMembership` (the session-only `PlayerMeta.guildMembership` stamp), the five op bodies `guildBankDepositGold`/`guildBankWithdrawGold`/`guildBankDeposit`/`guildBankWithdraw`/`guildBankBuySlots` (behind `requireOfficerBook` + the anonymous-pipe item policy `guildBankPipeRefusal`, whose refusal SET is direction-independent while its WORDING is direction-aware: deposit names the dimension, withdraw speaks one line), `guildBankInfoFor` (proximity + rank gated, boundary-clones, dormant slots projected), the OPERATOR pair `guildBankInfoForGuild` (ungated guild-id read, deliberately UNprojected so a purge's ledger row keeps the real instance payload as evidence; server-only, never IWorld) + `purgeDormantGuildBankSlot` (the admin escape hatch: removes exactly one slot the pipe refuses, returns the removed clone, refuses everything a guild could withdraw itself, and rides `runGuildBankOp` like every other book mutation so its `admin_purge` delta replays and reverts), the Phase 3 host seams `evictGuildBank` (the sanctioned evict) / `guildBankHoldings` (the fail-closed disband-guard read) / `chargeGuildCreationFee` + `refundGuildCreationFee` (the reserve-at-gate fee pair) / the ESCROW REPLAY PAIR: `GuildBankOpDelta` (a session's own book delta, with slot ops recorded ABSOLUTELY as `purchasedSlotsBefore`/`purchasedSlotsAfter`, never as a relative grant), `applyGuildBankDeltasTo` (forward, onto DURABLE truth: the escrow save's payload builder, ALL-OR-NOTHING, returning null or the `GuildBankDeltaDeficit` that stopped it; it never clamps a shortfall away and never half-writes, because a book half that cannot be applied must take its paired CHARACTER half down with it), `revertGuildBankDeltasTo` + the `revertGuildBankDeltas(ctx, ...)` delegate (backward, onto the LIVE book, a compare-and-swap on the ladder witness; canonical-JSON instance match, grants through `addStacked`), and `netGuildBankOpLogForReplay` (the replay-EQUIVALENT netting the escrow merge falls back to; it lives here, beside the applier it must agree with, because rung 0's purse price must not be netted in); cross-imports `nearBanker`/`moveBetweenContainers` from `bank.ts` and `addStacked` from `bags.ts` (the invited reuse seams); books on `Sim.guildBanks` (a `SimContext` view keyed by guild id, empty offline); draws NO rng |
| `loot/loot_roll.ts` + `loot/loot_ffa.ts` | loot rolls, corpse loot, party-loot strategy, `rollLoot`; the tap-lock FFA timeout |
| `deeds.ts` | the Book of Deeds evaluator (`updateDeeds`): runs at the very end of the tick tail (grant evaluation over dirty players only via `markDeedsDirty`, plus a 1 Hz proximity sweep for visit marks), draws NO rng, grants into `PlayerMeta.deedsEarned` + maintains `deedStats`/`renown`, emits id-based `deedUnlocked` (retro on join); plus the bespoke `manual`-deed grant sites and the session-only `DeedRuntime` encounter tracking. Authoring contract: `docs/design/deeds.md` |
| `dead_gate.ts` | `refusedWhileDead`: the shared while-dead refusal for the profession-action wrappers on `Sim` (craft/train/salvage/disenchant/enchant-apply/unbind), mobile-station placement, the tool-effect slot/recharge arms, and the rift forge; emits the matcher-covered error line and suppresses any result event, draws NO rng |
| `mob/rift_escape_window.ts` | the rift boss escape-window seam: `riftEscapeWindowActive` (is a telegraph in flight), the stomp/aoePulse windup constants + `resetRiftMechanicWindups`, and `impairedZoneFuseMult` (impairment-scaled death-zone fuses); consumed by the `mob/locomotion.ts` drivers, the anti-kite snare hold, and the `mob/mob_swing.ts` control-proc suppression; draws NO rng |
| `professions/` | gathering/crafting/enchanting/salvage/archetypes; governed by its own `CLAUDE.md` (hooks `drainGatheringGrants` into the per-player tick) |
| `pvp/` | WARFARE honor currency + combat-rating rules (`honor.ts` behind the seam; pure rating math in `power.ts`); governed by its own `CLAUDE.md` |

Enumerate the live set: `grep -rl sim_context src/sim --include='*.ts'`; every hit must be
a row here or a Key files entry (`sim.ts`, `sim_context.ts`, `entity_roster.ts`).

### Pure leaves (no `SimContext`; a Vitest imports them directly)
`threat.ts`/`spatial.ts`/`format_money.ts` above are the pattern; reuse or imitate one of
these before inlining pure logic in a system module: `spell_scaling.ts` (spell/attack
power coefficients), `stun_dr.ts` (CC diminishing-return categories), `item_level.ts`/
`item_budget.ts`/`item_level_req.ts` (drop power math), `equipment_rules.ts` (equip
legality), `launch_paperdoll_slots.ts` (the FROZEN launch-era eleven-slot list, for
launch-era completeness records ONLY: never validate a slot against it, use
`isEquipSlot` from `types.ts`, which is derived from the live `ALL_EQUIP_SLOTS`),
`cooldown_persist.ts` (cooldown save/load), `unstuck_cooldown.ts` (the hidden
recovery timer across competitive resets), `tab_target.ts`/`assist.ts`/
`dead_target.ts` (target cycling, /assist, dead-target selectability), `flee_speed.ts`,
`professions/node_persist.ts` (per-player node-readiness save/load, the
`cooldown_persist.ts` scheme applied to gather nodes),
`mob/scan_counters.ts` (the per-tick mob scan-visit tally the server reads post-tick),
`mob/mechanic_spacing.ts` (the rift boss shared mechanic spacing lock and its
oldest-due drain; stamped per-spawn by `rift/runs.ts`, consumed by the
`runMobAttackMechanics` drivers),
`lockpick.ts` (the minigame core behind `delves/lockpick_controller.ts`), `map_doc.ts`
(the custom-map document/validator), `geometry2d.ts`, `market_query.ts`,
`market_listing_ids.ts` (the World Market's id allocator: the reserved house band plus
the load-time reissue that keeps one row per id),
`vendor_stack.ts`, `vendor_buy_stack.ts` (vendor purchase quantity math: the bulk verb,
count sanitize, overflow-guarded totals, the Q23 force-1 predicate, and the prompt cap,
shared by `items.ts` buyItem and the vendor window's preview so no affordance can promise
a quantity the buy path refuses; also exports `VendorBuyOptions`, the one buyItem request
shape), `loot_master.ts`, `aura_classify.ts` (buff-vs-debuff, shared with the
HUD), `material_taxonomy.ts` (the honest depositable/browsable material set, derived
from the node-yield/grade/harvest/salvage/reagent content tables; consumed ONLY by
`src/ui`, never by the sim itself, and no `src/sim` file may import it, see its header),
`resurrection.ts` (both sicknesses, The Keeper's Toll and the shorter Unstuck one,
shared by every death site), and the combat
leaves `spell_resist.ts`/`ranged_shot.ts`/`aura_stacking.ts`/`aura_cancel.ts`/
`exclusive_aura.ts`/`form_swing.ts`, `jail.ts` (moderation-jail cage layout, gate
teleport, visitor spot; the jail SYSTEM logic stays on `Sim`),
`vehicle_motion.ts` (the arcade driving model behind the `p.drive` branch of
`player_motion.ts`: throttle/brake, steering authority, grip and drift, every number
read from a `content/vehicles.ts` profile),
`realm_racers_track_limits.ts` (the track-limits REFEREE: an excursion may not gain
arc on the ground it drove, so cutting the inside and cutting the outside of a
re-entrant shape are the same call and neither needs a barrier. It replaced a whole
family of derived containment devices, which is why the Realm Racers garden is open
and drivable to the perimeter on both sides; `social/realm_racers.ts` owns the
consequences, this owns the verdict),
`realm_racers_ground.ts` (the shape of the LAND: a circuit's authored `groundOutline`
read as the same closed centripetal Catmull-Rom the centerline is, memoized per record
identity. Absent means the rectangle the ground has always been (`regionHalf*` plus
`REALM_RACERS_LAWN_OVERSHOOT`), which is what let the field arrive without either shipped
circuit changing; the two grew later, when the instance volume became the ceiling on every
circuit, so that rectangle is now the ceiling plus the overshoot on both. The renderer cuts its lawn along what this
returns and puts the theme's water outside it, and the readout measures the road against
it (`road_outside_ground_outline`). It also answers `realmRacersOnGround`, which every
DERIVED fill on a circuit asks before it places a piece (the seeded scatters here, the
meadow mask and the flower beds render-side): all of them are generated over the perimeter
BOX, and a box is not a shape, so without it an island wore a rectangle of grass standing
on the sea. The water outside is DECORATION: it stops nobody, and the perimeter box is
still the one thing that does),
`realm_racers_props_resolve.ts` (the ONE place a circuit's hand-placed scenery turns
into positions: authored `props` in either track-space or circuit-local coordinates,
seeded `scatters`, and the free-form `ponds` outline. The renderer instances what it
returns and `realm_racers_colliders.ts` appends what it marks solid, so neither
re-derives a placement, which is the defect class the whole seam exists for. Every
point comes out of `hash2`, never `ctx.rng`: content resolves at import time on three
hosts. Footprints and heights come from `content/realm_racers_props.ts`, the sim-side
catalog whose keys `src/render/realm_racers_prop_visuals.ts` mirrors),
`realm_racers_pickups.ts` (the pickup boxes: a circuit's authored `pickupRows` resolved
into four boxes across the road at that arc, memoized per circuit like the rest of the
derived geometry, plus the per-race take/respawn step over a plain state the match owns.
The take is the NEAREST box in reach with the lowest index on a tie, which is a rule
rather than a tidy-up: on the narrowest shipped road two boxes of one row are closer
together than the catch radius, so a pass down the middle really is inside both
(`pickup_row_lanes_overlap` is the readout warning that names such a row). Since 22b the
phase draws EXACTLY ONE value per box that changes hands (the weighted effect draw, taken
at the take), so a tick with no take still draws nothing; `social/realm_racers.ts` owns the
consequences, this owns where the boxes are and which of them changed hands),
`realm_racers_pickup_effects.ts` (what a box GIVES: the effect vocabulary, which two of the
four a racer HOLDS rather than receives (nitro and oil are one-charge abilities in the kit,
spent when the pilot chooses; the refill and the ward are instant), the three
position-weighted tables a take draws from (leader / midfield / backmarker, ranked among
the racers STILL DRIVING), and the nitro tuning. Plain data plus one cumulative walk over
it; the draw takes a roll in [0, 1) rather than reaching for randomness, so the single
`ctx.rng` draw stays at the one site in the rally tick that owns it, and the stacking
fallback (a full slot draws the refill instead) is decided AFTER the draw so the tables
keep their meaning),
`realm_racers_slicks.ts` (the oil a spent `slick` leaves under the machine: the patch
record, its lifetime, the concurrent-patch CAP the renderer's pool is sized from, the
per-tick step that sweeps the expired ones and reports who drove through one, and how hard
the oil throws them. It spares the machine that dropped it only until that machine has
LEFT it once (the drop is under their own wheels, so without the grace they would catch
their own patch on the tick they spent it; after it, a patch laid into a hairpin is ground
like any other). It reports a machine standing in a patch every tick, because deciding
what a REPEAT means (one event, one ward, one grip window) is the race's business and not
the geometry's. The THROW it returns is the half of a slick that does not depend on what
the machine was doing: grip is a rate, so on its own it does nothing at all to a machine
travelling straight. It is a LATERAL velocity impulse and never a yaw one, which is a
feel finding rather than a taste: the driving model conserves world velocity through a
body rotation, so a yaw impulse leaves the trajectory untouched at the instant it lands
and only swings the nose, and a chase camera glued to that nose reports it as a violent
steering input. It shipped that way once and read as exactly that. Its direction follows
the slide, then the side of the patch, then a stateless `hash2` of the pair, never
`ctx.rng`. The oil also RAISES the machine's slide ceiling while it bites
(`VehicleDrive.slipCap`, on the surface seam beside `gripMult`/`speedCap`), because a
ceiling is not a modifier: a machine attacking a corner already sits at `maxSlip`, so
before that the shove delivered nothing at all to the only pilots worth shoving, and no
value of `_PUSH` could have fixed it),
`realm_racers_draft_registry.ts` (the session-only DRAFT circuit overlay: a table
with NO runtime imports at all, because both `content/realm_racers_circuits.ts` and
`realm_racers_layout.ts` consult it and either importing something that imported it
back would be a cycle through a module that builds its table at import time. Empty
unless a dev command filled it, so nothing deterministic observes it. It is
CONTENT, so it is process-wide rather than per-`Sim`, and OFFLINE HOSTS ONLY in
practice: the server never runs a dev command. Two derived caches key off a
circuit id and both hold their entry only while the RECORD is the same object
(`memoizePerCircuit` in `realm_racers_spline.ts`, the cache in
`realm_racers_colliders.ts`); a THIRD such cache is the signal to stop adding
identity guards one at a time and give this table a generation counter instead),
and
`professions/proficiency_display_heal.ts` (the one-time gathering-proficiency
display-band heal applied at character load). A leaf is any `src/sim`
file with no `sim_context` import.

## The SimContext seam (final shape)
`sim_context.ts` defines `SimContext` = `SimContextPrimitives` (live getters onto the
running `Sim`) + `SimContextCallbacks` (cross-system functions). `Sim.buildSimContext()`
binds every member. The seam carries two kinds of callback:

- **Owned by a module** (the binding points at the module; `Sim` keeps a thin delegate for
  foreign callers): e.g. `dealDamage`/`handleDeath`/`grantXp` (damage), `runEffects`
  (effect dispatch), `updateMob`/`onBossDeath` (locomotion), `updateNythraxisEncounter`
  (encounter), `rollLoot` (loot), `updateDelveCompanion` (companion), etc.
- **Still on `Sim` / shared** (exposed through the seam but the body stays on `Sim`):
  the shared combat/movement entry points below, plus core helpers like `resolve`,
  `playerMods`, `enterCombat`, `isHostileTo`/`isFriendlyTo`, `addItem`/`removeItem`/
  `countItem` (inventory hub), and `isControlAura` (the general CC predicate).

**Shared entry points: never owned by one slice, never deleted** (called from multiple
foreign hot paths, reachable via `SimContext`):
- `mobSwing`: base mob hit-table shell on `Sim`; callers in mob combat, profiled mob
  combat, the melee pet attack, and the delve companion attack.
- `updateRangedPetAttack`: mob ranged path + hunter pet ranged.
- `pulseGroundAoE`: the per-tick ground-AoE pulse AND the effect-dispatch on-cast path
  (two callers; the dispatch caller is the easy-to-miss one).
- `applyTaunt`: player ability/effect, pet, and pet-attack paths.
- `meleeSwing`: body lives in `combat/auto_attack.ts`; `Sim` keeps the thin delegate
  because both the auto-attack driver and the `castAbility` weaponStrike path use it.
- `moveToward` / `fleeMoveSpeed`: shared movement entries used by mob/pet/companion/NPC.

If you ever find a `SimContext` member with zero consumers, that is dead scaffolding:
remove the declaration AND its binding in the same change, then re-run the parity gate.

## Determinism as it bites here
- Randomness: `this.rng` only; `time`/`tickCount` are sim-clock fields advanced by `tick()`, use them, not wall-clock. The banned-API list is enforced mechanically by `tests/architecture.test.ts`.
- Fixed step: everything scales by `DT` (=1/20). There is no variable delta. The seed is fixed once in the `Sim` ctor.
- Order matters: one shared `mulberry32` stream feeds every draw site. Changing the
  tick-phase order, an entity-iteration order, or an early-bail that can draw rng shifts
  the global draw order and forks the world. Don't reorder `tick()` or a loop casually;
  the parity gate's draw-order log catches it.

## sim.ts coordinator map (what `tick()` does, in order)
`tick()` reads as a linear registry of system calls routed through `this.ctx`, in phase
GROUPS: advance the clock; the prologue (respawns, world bosses, ground AoEs, despawn
decay, in-flight projectiles); the per-player loop (movement/doors/casting/auto-attack/
regen for live players, the ghost-run arm for released spirits, timers + auras for dead
players too, intentionally); the per-entity loop (mob update + auras, friendly-NPC aura
cleanse, object respawn); the `engagedPids` combat-flag pass (reads pet AND mob state
after both update: this STAYS in the coordinator, never moves into a slice); the
end-of-tick system block in fixed order (duels, Card Duel pairing + AFK deadlines,
arena, trades/ready-checks, ..., through the delayed-event drain, then the
deeds evaluator `updateDeeds`: zero rng, after the drain so it sees same-tick results); grid
re-bucketing LAST, then drain + return the `SimEvent[]`. The authoritative phase list is
`tick()` itself: most phases carry a self-naming `lap?('...')` marker (a few adjacent
calls share one, e.g. trades + ready checks), so read those,
not a doc copy. Phase ORDER is rng-draw-order load-bearing (see Determinism); a
zero-rng phase (Vale Cup) may append, anything else must not reorder.

Beyond `tick()`, `sim.ts` legitimately keeps: the `IWorld` facade delegates, the
back-compat accessors (`player`/`inventory`/`xp`/`equipment`/`questLog`/`talents`/... that
delegate to the primary player; per-player state lives in `PlayerMeta`, not the `Entity`),
a thin `chat()` delegate (the router body lives in `social/chat.ts`), the inventory hub,
persistence (`serializeCharacter`/`addPlayer`), the shared entry points above, and
`buildSimContext()`. A NEW self-contained system belongs in its own sibling module behind
`SimContext`, not as another method cluster on `Sim`.

## Tuning constants: change numbers THERE, not inline
- Global gameplay/formulas: top of **`types.ts`** (`MELEE_RANGE`, `MELEE_ARC`, `LEASH_DISTANCE`, `GCD`, `XP_TABLE`, rage/hit/armor fns, ...).
- Sim-internal knobs live as a named `const` next to their owning module (`GRAVITY` in `player_motion.ts`, `PARTY_*` in `social/party.ts`, `MARKET_*` in `market.ts`, ...); a few remain atop `sim.ts` (`CHARGE_*`, `PET_*`, `ARENA_LADDER_SIZE`). Edit the named const, don't hardcode magic numbers in methods.

## Talking to the outside
- Output is the **`SimEvent`** union (`types.ts`). Code calls `this.emit(ev)` (or `ctx.emit` from a module); `tick()` returns the drained `SimEvent[]`. An event with `pid` is personal (delivered only to that player's owner); without `pid` it's world-visible.
- Stepping: callers run `sim.tick()` per frame (`server/game.ts`; `headless/env_server.ts` loops it `frameSkip` times). The sim never self-schedules.

## Player-facing text is English here (localized at the client)
- The sim carries **no `t()`/DOM/i18n imports**. Player-visible strings are emitted as
  English literals/templates on `SimEvent`s via `this.emit`, `this.error(pid, text)`
  (`type:'error'` toast), `this.notice(pid, text)` (`type:'log'` line), and
  `stopFollow(p, msg)` (routes `msg` through `this.error`). A module emits the same way
  through `ctx.emit`/`ctx.error`/`ctx.notice`. Translation happens only at the client
  boundary, in `src/ui/sim_i18n.ts` (`localizeSimText`): an `EXACT` map of placeholder-free
  strings plus ordered `RULES` regexes that re-render each emit through `t()`/`tSim()`.
- **Money is built English here, re-localized client-side.** The sim has its OWN
  `formatMoney` in **`format_money.ts`** (NOT the `src/ui/i18n.ts` one) that yields plain
  `"3g 5s"` fragments inside loot/quest/vendor/market emit text; this is intentional (the
  sim stays language-agnostic). The client re-renders those amounts locale-aware in hud's
  `localizeLootText` arm: `parseSimMoney` reverses the `"Ng Ns Nc"` fragment back to copper,
  then the i18n `formatMoney` formats it. Don't reach for the i18n `formatMoney`/`formatNumber`
  here, and don't hand-format with a separator a locale would change.
- **Dev-channel text stays English.** The sim's only non-player text is a few
  `console.warn` diagnostics (no user-surfaced `throw`s); they are never matched. If a
  string would ever feed both a diagnostic log and a player-visible `SimEvent`, split it
  so only the player arm (`error`/`notice`) is registered in `sim_i18n.ts`.
- **Changing or adding a player string is a two-file change:** edit the literal at its
  emit site (in `sim.ts` OR the owning module) AND add/update the matching `EXACT` value or
  `RULE` (plus its `BASE_DICT` / EXTRA-table key) in `sim_i18n.ts`, in the same change.
  Broad multi-capture `RULES` (e.g. `unleashes`) stay LAST, after the specific
  `{name} {verb}!` rules.
- The **S3 drift guard** (`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) parses the sim files at test
  time and fails CI on any emit no client matcher recognizes. It only sees string
  **literals** at the emit site: variable-routed emits (e.g. `helpLines()` looped through
  `error(id, line)`) and `?? 'English'` fallbacks are invisible. Strings that ship English
  on purpose (the v0.7 slash-command readouts) are tracked in the status registry
  (`blockedSource` / `ALLOW_V07_SLASH`); prefer a literal at the emit site so the guard
  keeps working.

## Adding a mechanic here
1. Add state to `Entity` (`types.ts`) and/or `PlayerMeta`; init it in `entity.ts` `baseEntity` / `createPlayer`. State stays on `Sim`/`Entity`, not in a module global.
2. Decide where the BEHAVIOR lives:
   - Extending an existing system -> its module (e.g. a new ability effect -> `combat/effect_dispatch.ts`).
   - A NEW self-contained system -> a NEW sibling module that talks only to `SimContext`. Add the callbacks it needs to `sim_context.ts` (append-only) and bind them in `buildSimContext()`; keep a thin `Sim` delegate if a foreign caller resolves the method on the facade.
   - Pure presentation/domain logic (geometry, formatting, id/state resolution) -> a small host-agnostic leaf module a Vitest imports directly (like `threat.ts`/`spatial.ts`/`format_money.ts`).
3. New randomness through `this.rng`/`ctx.rng`; new output via `emit` (add a `SimEvent` variant if needed). Keep new `tick()` work in the right phase; don't reorder existing phases.
4. If render/UI must see it or trigger it: **add the member to the matching `IWorld` facet (`src/world_api/<domain>.ts`), implement in BOTH `Sim` and `ClientWorld` (`src/net/online.ts`), and update the `IWORLD_MEMBERS` pin (`tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`)**: presentation never reaches into `Sim` directly.
5. Add/adjust a Vitest (`tests/`), ideally a determinism/replay assertion; a new mechanic with rng draws wants a `tests/parity` scenario. If the mechanic is conquerable content (a dungeon, delve, raid, world boss, zone, or rare), author its Book of Deeds records in the SAME change (recipe in `docs/design/deeds.md`).
6. Fix bugs test-first: reproduce with a failing Vitest against the owning module (or the `Sim` facade; extract the unit under test into its own leaf if it is buried), then the smallest change that turns it green. A fix touching rng draw sites re-runs `tests/parity`.

## Never here
- **Never derive player stats outside `recalcPlayerStats`**, and don't walk the talent tree per-tick: talents are precomputed into the flat `TalentModifiers` at allocation/respec time.
