// Plays a hoard boss's authored body gesture for a cue, at the beat the pure core
// (hoard_boss_gestures_core.ts) names. Local presentation only: the cue, its
// timing and every hit come from the authoritative world; this only asks the
// renderer's one-shot route to animate the body that owns it.
//
// Cost: nothing outside a hoard fight. While a gesture cue is live and unplayed
// its boss is looked up once (an entity scan), then the cue is remembered as
// played until it leaves the cue list.
