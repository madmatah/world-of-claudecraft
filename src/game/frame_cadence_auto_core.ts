// The automatic Frame Rate Limit: settle, then hold. It lowers the ceiling only
// on a machine that demonstrably cannot hold its display's rhythm, and after a
// settle phase it leaves the cadence alone: the player wants a stable rhythm
// more than the last frames per second.
//
// The contract. Once settled, the cadence changes only:
// - because of something the player did (the wiring invalidates the verdict);
// - downward, when the rhythm in force is demonstrably missed;
// - through a small per-session budget of self-initiated probes, each aborted
//   within a handful of frames, never in combat or near a loading transition,
//   and only on positive evidence of headroom.
// A failed verdict is remembered across sessions (the wiring owns the storage).
//
// Two controllers share the frame: the quality governor (render_budget.ts) and
// this one. Quality is shed first: the ceiling only steps down once the governor
// has stopped shedding. While a verdict is still being formed (a provisional
// hold, a probe, the probation after a passed probe) the governor holds its
// levels, so a probe measures the scene and not quality that just came back.
// In a CONFIRMED hold the headroom goes to quality: the governor judges the
// chosen cadence through its miss share and restores what that cadence carries.
// That is also what makes the headroom evidence mean something: a machine that
// cannot restore its baseline quality at the ceiling has nothing left for a
// faster cadence, and is never asked.
//
// Readings that straddle a stall of a second or more are dropped (they are not
// readings), so the rules need whole bursts of play between stalls: the floor
// is the 120-frame recent ring. Measured through the wiring: a machine stalling
// after every 0.8 s of play is never even read as paced; every one or two
// seconds it is paced but never limited; every three seconds or more, it is.
//
// Pure: rendered frames in, the ceiling intent out. Every threshold is a share
// of frames, a count of frames or a duration of play, never a frame time
// calibrated on a machine.
