// Where a Store decision prompt (store_decision_prompt.ts) mounts.
//
// Ordinarily #prompt-stack: it sits inside #ui and hud.css lifts it to z-index
// 96 while a decision is active, above the 50-89 window band. The two inspect
// overlays (armory_inspect.ts and mount_inspect_controller.ts) do NOT live in
// #ui: they mount on document.body at z-index 90, and #ui is itself a
// position:fixed stacking context at z-index 10 (base.css). Nothing inside #ui,
// whatever its own z-index, can paint above a body-level overlay. So a purchase
// confirm raised from an open inspector mounted UNDER the overlay's dimmer and
// behind its dialog: invisible to the player, while its focused Confirm button
// still took Enter (the "click does nothing, click then Enter buys it" report).
// Hit-testing hid the fault too: the controller makes the overlay inert, and
// inert elements are skipped by pointer hit-testing, so the covered prompt was
// still clickable by a player who knew where it was.
//
// While an inspect overlay is open the prompt therefore takes a body-level
// sibling host, #store-prompt-stack, which hud.css floors above the overlay
// with the same geometry as #prompt-stack. The nonmodal purchase result takes
// the same rule. The host exists only while a prompt is mounted in it.
//
// The host is resolved ONCE, when a prompt opens, and a mounted prompt never
// migrates. A caller that opens an inspect overlay while a decision is live
// must dismiss that decision first (daily_rewards_window.ts previewMountSkin
// invalidates the store surface in the same synchronous block), or the
// decision it leaves in #prompt-stack paints under the new overlay.
