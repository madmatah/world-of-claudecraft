# Factions and standing

The reputation layer the world quests feed. Three factions, each owning a
group of zones, earn standing from world-quest turn-ins; standing climbs a
tier ladder that unlocks a quartermaster's stock, records deeds, and shows on
the character sheet. This page is the design contract; the code anchors are
`src/sim/factions.ts` (factions, zone map, tiers, thresholds, the award
function), `src/sim/content/faction_vendors.ts` (the quartermasters, the
taskmaster and their stock) and `tests/factions.test.ts` (the pinned rules).

## The factions

| Faction | Hub | Quartermaster | Zones |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rift Watch | Drifthaven | Quartermaster Vaelen | the Rift Watch group of `ZONE_TO_FACTION` |
| Church Order | Brother Aldric, Eastbrook Vale | Templar Althea (the Eastbrook chapel) | the Church Order group |
| Automatons | Wyrmwatch | Artificer Tobrin | the Automaton group |

`ZONE_TO_FACTION` in `src/sim/factions.ts` is the one map from a zone to its
faction; `worldQuestFaction` resolves a world quest to its faction (an explicit
override on the quest record, else the zone). Faction and tier display names are
`t()` keys under `hudChrome.reputation` (still marked provisional pending
narrative's final names).

## Earning standing

- The only standing source is a world-quest turn-in (`awardWorldQuest` in
  `src/sim/world_quests.ts`), plus the `/dev rep` command behind
  `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS` for testing. Every world quest counts toward the faction
  of its zone, so all three factions progress at once.
- `worldQuestStandingReward` sets the award per quest and per level bracket so
  that a full daily circuit lands the same standing on every faction; the exact
  amounts are pinned by `tests/factions.test.ts` ("synchronized daily reward
  math"), never restated here.
- `awardFactionReputation` is the single mutation: it adds, clamps to the level
  cap (`maxStandingForLevel`: the lower bracket pauses at Trusted, the upper
  bracket runs to Champion), and reports the tier before and after so a caller
  can tell a tier from a plain gain.
- One confirmed reroll per day, from the map's World Quests board
  (`src/sim/world_quest_reroll.ts`); Taskmaster Kaelen's dialog opens the board.
- The second source is the weekly emissary's commendation
  (`commendWeeklyQuest` in `src/sim/weekly_quests.ts`,
  `WEEKLY_QUEST_REWARD.commendationStanding`): once the week's charge is
  finished, the owner names ONE faction from the emissary's window and it
  receives the commendation through `awardFactionReputation`. One claim a
  week, recorded on the weekly pick (`commended`), so it rides the `wkq` self
  key and the character save; a faction with no headroom at the level cap is
  refused and the choice stays open rather than being wasted.

## Tiers

Six tiers, `STANDING_TIERS` with `STANDING_THRESHOLDS`: Unknown, Recognized,
Trusted, Proven, Vanguard, Champion. Each faction names them with its own
flavor titles (`FACTION_TIER_TITLES`); `factionTierTitle` is the one resolver
and the character sheet shows the current title.

## What standing unlocks

- **Quartermaster stock: the ladder.** Each quartermaster sells a standing
  ladder (`FACTION_VENDOR_STOCK`, gated row by row through
  `FACTION_VENDOR_GATES`), refused with the `hudChrome.reputation.vendorGate`
  line until the buyer's standing meets the row's tier. Factions own the
  PERIPHERY the raid never fills, the classic reputation-gear shape: the five
  set slots and the top weapons stay raid prestige, and every tier sells
  something a player uses the day it opens. Each faction serves one role family
  across its ladder (Rift Watch: Agility; Church Order: casters and healers;
  Automatons: Strength and the stamina line), and every budget is COPIED from a
  live raid or heroic row (`tests/faction_vendors.test.ts` pins each mirror):
  - Recognized: a neck at the heroic five-man vendor's budget.
  - Trusted: a ring at the same budget, plus the faction's bag.
  - Proven: waist and feet at the raid offset budget, a pre-raid set-slot
    piece at the heroic five-man budget, and the faction's enchant formulas.
  - Vanguard: a proc weapon on the heroic five-man weapon bar (the Rift
    Watch's 1.6-speed blade is the first fast non-dagger one-hander).
  - Champion: the jewelry gaps: Agility jewels, stamina-line tank jewels, a
    second caster and healer ring, each carrying the raid jewel's rating with
    its line one point under the raid row it mirrors (a rival, never a tie).
    The Rift Watch's Champion row also sells the Viridian Valestrider's reins
    (the faction mount: a teal coast-runner on the Agility line; the reins def
    stays with the other reins in `content/items.ts`) at the classic epic-mount
    ratio, ten times the Valorsteed, behind the same riding and
    one-per-account gates every reins purchase carries. The Reliquary hints the
    mount at the quartermaster and it leaves the pending-ruling list. The
    Church Order and the Automatons get their own mounts when their assets
    land (Terrid's Dawn Strider is the Church Order's).
  Every gear and bag row binds on purchase (`soulbound`), because the standing
  gate sits on the buyer and an unbound row would let a Champion hand the
  ladder to an alt with no standing. Two rows stay transferable by contract:
  the Valestrider's reins (the mount contract) and the formulas (patterns are
  bind-by-consumption and deliberately listable; learning spends the copy). Every equipment row also pins `requiredLevel: 20`
  explicitly: the stock is untiered, so without the pin the level gate would
  fall to the quality floor (rare 12, epic 18) while every mirrored raid and
  heroic row requires 20. `tests/faction_vendors.test.ts` pins both.
  A fresh 20 holds no standing, so the dev kit excludes the ladder outright
  (`isFreshTwentyItem`); the epic BiS picker sees the Champion jewels but the
  one-point margin keeps every dev kit and DPS fixture on its release loadout.
- **Enchant formulas.** At Proven each quartermaster sells bind-on-pickup
  formulas that teach a LEARNED enchant at Enchanting 100, the way Zeal is
  learned: Riftwalker's Grace (the Agility sibling of Zeal, Mongoose to
  Crusader ratio, with the classic 2% haste), Dawnfire Etching (flat Spell
  Power) and Dawn's Benediction (flat Healing Power), and Piston Drive (a
  two-hander-only Strength and crit line, refused on a one-hander). Standing
  gates the formula; the enchant itself is tradeable labour, so enchanters
  have a reason to hold standing and everyone else buys the etching. Figures
  and their derivations are pinned in `tests/enchants_magnitude_invariants.test.ts`
  (the learned block) and the runtime in `tests/faction_enchants.test.ts`.
- **Deeds.** Reaching Trusted with a faction and Champion with a faction each
  record a Book of Deeds entry, and Champion with all three is its own capstone
  deed; the Champion deeds grant a title. They read standing through the
  `standing*` deed meters (`src/sim/deeds.ts`), which the award site marks
  dirty so the grant lands on the same tick as the turn-in.
- **Titles.** The per-tier flavor titles are display text on the Reputation
  tab; wearable titles come from the Champion deeds through the Book of Deeds
  title picker, like every other title.

## Surfacing

- **Reputation tab** of the character sheet (`src/ui/hud/reputation/`): one
  card per faction with the standing pill, tier bar, next-tier line and the
  faction title; the "standing pauses at {tier}" line for the lower bracket.
- **Chat log.** Every gain lands a loot-channel line naming the faction and the
  amount.
- **Tier reached.** Crossing into a new tier shows the deed-class celebration
  plate (tier and faction, the faction title as subtext), a gold chat line, the
  polite announce and the achievement chime. It is a state-diff observer over
  `IWorld.factions` (`faction_tier_celebration_view.ts`), not a sim event, so it
  works identically offline and online with no wire work; it gates on the same
  sync flag as the profession observers because `fac` ships in the same self
  snapshot, and it baselines silently so a login never toasts history.
- **Online.** `meta.factions` rides the `fac` self key (server
  `quest_snapshot_wire.ts`, client `faction_snapshot_wire.ts`), sanitized by
  the same `sanitizeFactionReputation` the save/load boundary uses.
- **Guide.** The public wiki page (`src/guide/pages/factions.ts`) explains the
  factions, tiers, titles and quartermasters spoiler-safe: names and roles only,
  never thresholds, amounts, stats or prices.

## Open design decisions

- The pace to Champion in the upper bracket is a maintainer call; the daily
  synchronization rule is fixed, the amounts are the knob.
- Further standing sources (regular quests, dungeon kills) stay open; any new
  source goes through `awardFactionReputation` and marks deeds dirty exactly
  like the world-quest site and the weekly commendation.
