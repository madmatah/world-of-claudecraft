// The line-count RATCHET for the repo's known monolith files. Module-first is the
// doctrine (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity): new logic lands as its own sibling module
// behind an existing seam, and the coordinator files below must never GROW. Between
// v0.30.0 and v0.36.0 every sanctioned coordinator grew anyway and several new
// monoliths formed, so the doctrine gets a deterministic gate: each named file has a
// ceiling a little above its size when this gate landed. Exceeding the ceiling fails
// the suite.
//
// How to respond to a failure here:
// - The fix is EXTRACTION, not raising the ceiling: move the new logic into a sibling
//   module behind the file's seam (listed per row below; recipe in the
//   extract-and-test skill, .claude/skills/extract-and-test/) and import it.
// - After a real extraction shrinks a file, LOWER its ceiling to the new size plus a
//   small margin in the same change; the ratchet only works if it tightens.
// - Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision: do it only when a change genuinely
//   cannot land behind a seam, keep the raise small, and justify it in the PR body.
// - A missing file usually means it was split or renamed: update or remove its row in
//   the same change so the gate tracks the real tree.
//
// Data-as-code is exempt by design (src/sim/content/, the i18n catalogs and matcher
// DICTs, generated artifacts): those tables are correctly large. This gate names only
// LOGIC files.

    // staging/scene-bookkeeping logic that first cut left inline here (and
    // that inline copy is what hid the bug, an `Object3D.add` reparent that

    // PR #3468 changes the shadow-depth prewarm material contract, but this

    // pool take/store halves (src/render/characters/pooled_visual_lifecycle.ts,

    // The touch tail's readiness threading (the gate result down to

    // single-use compilePriorityFor wrapper folded into the one gate that
    // called it, the core it delegated to being its whole body (net 0).
    // Lowered again by the build-ledger instrumentation, which paid for its
    // producers (timed view and zone feature builds, the arrival mark, the

    // stat shapes into src/render/zone_prepare_stats.ts and the hitch scratch
    // factory into scene_census_core.ts (net -1).

    // the other zero fixtures and the created-view type sampler into
    // view_candidate_pool_core.ts (net -16).
    // Lowered again by the gc hitch cause, whose heap read (heap_sample.ts)
    // paid for its import and sample line by folding the key-light follow
    // beside it onto its single statement (net -1).
    // Lowered again by the deferred-decal stand-in (the live candidate path
    // builds the body without its face decals and attaches them on the
    // pieces' arrival), which paid for its wiring by moving the mobile
    // opening render scale into dynamic_resolution_core.ts (net -1).

    // Lowered again by the compile gate's variant settle
    // (program_variant_settle.ts, the third piece arm both gates bind), which
    // paid for its wiring by moving the open-air fog predicate beside the
    // FogSceneState it classifies (interior_light_rig.ts isOpenAirFogState),
    // landing with the shadow arm's every-mesh twin swap in the same change
    // (net -3).

    // The upstream/main merge landed upstream's own growth (the mount-program

    // extractions, so the pin is the exact merged count, still lower than
    // upstream main's own (13744), and any growth reds again.
    // RAISED 13546 -> 13548 (+2) by the streamed-prewarm branch. A raise, not a
    // lowering, and stated as one: the branch extracts the compile SUBMIT LOOP
    // with its deadline rule and never-drop contract
    // (runPrewarmCompileSubmission, src/render/prewarm_compile_submission_core.ts,
    // beside the per-unit submit that module already owned) and the weapon-skin
    // resume unit PLAN (weaponVfxPrewarmUnits, src/render/weapon_vfx_prewarm.ts,

    // two extractions still do not quite cover what it adds.
    //
    // The history matters because it is the failure mode this ratchet exists to
    // catch. An earlier revision of this branch reported a NET REDUCTION while
    // deleting 41 lines of load-bearing comments, 11 blank lines and folding
    // three `let` declarations into one comma statement: the extractions were
    // real but the number was bought with formatting. Every comment is restored,
    // the blank lines are back, the declarations are separate again, and the
    // count below is what the extractions alone earn. Maintainer decision, and
    // deliberately a visible +2 rather than an invisible -9.
    // Re-pinned 13548 -> 13551 when the rift long-session perf branch merged
    // this base: both parents grew the file independently (upstream's interior
    // resource registry wiring, this branch's object-view material disposal,
    // sparkle tags and the rift build-key cooldown, all thin consumers of
    // extracted modules). Exact merged count, zero slack: any further growth
    // reds again.

    // Meanwhile on the release base: re-pinned 13548 -> 13563 (+15) when the
    // fast-loading-screen-variety branch merged release/v0.40.0 (thin-consumer
