// Minimal AI pull-request reviewer. Sends the PR diff to an OpenRouter model (default:
// the free nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free model) and posts the review as a
// sticky comment on the PR. No new npm deps: Node 18+ global fetch + the GitHub REST
// API.
//
// Two ways to trigger it (both wired in .github/workflows/pr-ai.yml):
//   - automatically on every push to the PR: DIFF_FILE points at a precomputed diff.
//   - on demand: an OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR comments `/review` or `/suggest <focus>`
//     on the PR. The workflow gates on the commenter's author_association; this script
//     fetches the diff itself via the GitHub API (no DIFF_FILE, no checkout of the PR
//     head) and posts a fresh reply comment keyed to the triggering comment, separate
//     from the sticky automatic review.
//
// It is best-effort and NON-BLOCKING: if OPENROUTER_API_KEY is absent (for example a
// fork PR that cannot read repo secrets) it prints a notice and exits 0, so it never
// gates a merge. The model is swappable via OPENROUTER_MODEL with zero workflow edits,
// which matters because free OpenRouter models can disappear or change at any time.
//
// PRIVACY: free OpenRouter models commonly log prompts to improve the model, so the
// diff you send may be retained by a third party. Check the model's Data Policy on
// openrouter.ai, or point OPENROUTER_MODEL at a non-logging / paid model (or a
// self-hosted one), before using this on code you cannot disclose.
//
// Env (set by the workflow):
//   OPENROUTER_API_KEY  OpenRouter key (repo secret); absent -> skip, exit 0
//   GITHUB_TOKEN        token with pull-requests:write (default Actions token)
//   GITHUB_REPOSITORY   owner/repo
//   PR_NUMBER           the pull request number
//   DIFF_FILE           path to a precomputed unified diff (automatic run); when absent,
//                       the diff is fetched from the GitHub API instead (comment run)
//   COMMENT_BODY        the triggering comment's body (comment run only)
//   COMMENT_ID          the triggering comment's id; keys its reply comment
//   COMMENT_AUTHOR      the triggering comment's author; credited in the reply
//   OPENROUTER_MODEL    model id (default nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free)
//   MAX_DIFF_CHARS      cap on diff chars sent to the model (default 60000)

const system = `You are a precise, skeptical senior code reviewer for World of ClaudeCraft, a TypeScript
micro-MMO and reinforcement-learning environment built on one deterministic 20 Hz simulation core.

You see ONLY a unified diff plus a list of files that ALREADY EXIST in the repository. Everything
not shown in the diff already exists and works. Do NOT flag an imported module, helper, or
referenced file as "missing" or "not in the diff": that is expected. If an import resolves to a path
in the existing-files list, it is fine. You are also given the list of declared package.json
dependencies; an import of any listed package is available, so NEVER say a dependency is missing
from package.json. When you cannot verify something from what you were given, ask a one-line
question at LOW severity instead of asserting a problem.

Invariant scope, apply LITERALLY and do not generalize beyond it: these rules constrain application
code under src/ ONLY.
- src/sim/ stays pure: no DOM/Three/render/ui/net imports; all randomness via the Rng helper, never
  Math.random / Date.now / performance.now.
- The server is authoritative; clients never decide outcomes.
- Every player-visible string rendered by the app is a t() key.
Code under scripts/, tests/, headless/, and CI YAML under .github/ is Node TOOLING: it is
English-only, exempt from t(), and may use Math.random / Date.now / child_process freely. NEVER
raise a t(), Rng, or sim-purity finding against a file outside src/. The "no em dashes, en dashes,
or emojis" rule applies everywhere.

Severity rubric, use it strictly:
- high: a real bug, security issue, or src/ invariant violation that WILL break behavior or fail CI
  AND that you can confirm from the diff alone.
- medium: likely incorrect or risky, but not certain.
- low: style, naming, maintainability, or a question.
If you CANNOT verify a finding from the diff and the provided context, it is AT MOST low and MUST be
phrased as a one-line question, never high or medium. Do not guess at repository state you were not
given (CI pins, other files' contents): if you did not see it, do not assert it.

Output rules: prefer FEW high-confidence findings over many. If you are not confident a finding is
real, OMIT it. Do not pad with generic advice. Only mention missing tests when the diff changes src/
or server logic that the repo actually tests. Do NOT add your own title or top-level heading (no
"# ..." or "## AI review"); start directly with the first group. Group findings under Correctness,
Invariants, Tests, Nits and tag each with its severity. If the change looks fine, say so in one line.
Do not restate the diff. Output GitHub-flavored Markdown.`;
